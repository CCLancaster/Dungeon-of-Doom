    <p>Well, hello there!</p>

        <p>Welcome intrepid adventurer. Turns out you're not very good at safely adventuring and have managed to trap yourself in a room that is slowly growing smaller...ancient earth temples and all that. Happily, you thought to bring your handy laser gun. Blast the blocks in front of the door to escape certain doom. Or you know...don't. Click Start to begin. Good luck!</p>

        <ul id="Instructions">How To Play:
          <li id="Instructions">  - the player moves only left [A] or right [D] at the bottom of the screen (room)</li>
          <li id="Instructions">- the player can fire a laser beam by pressing [Enter].</li>
          <li id="Instructions">- the projectile laser beam can only move on a linear path</li>
          <li id="Instructions">- blocks are randomly placed in the top two rows of the screen (room)</li>
          <li id="Instructions">- the exit door is randomly placed along the top line of the screen (along the x = 0 line)</li>
          <li id="Instructions">- the ceiling will drop down after a specified interval, effectively making the room smaller</li>
          <li id="Instructions">- if the player comes in contact with a block, they die</li>
          <li id="Instructions">- clearing a path to the door wins the game</li>
